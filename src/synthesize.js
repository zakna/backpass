/**
 * Stage 3 of the pipeline (design section 3): high-reasoning synthesis that turns folded
 * evidence into concrete edits.
 *
 * The agent never describes an edit for backpass to locate - it makes the edit, with its
 * harness's own file tools, in a staging copy of the memory file and project skills
 * (`src/workspace.js`). A run starts in one session with two kinds of turn:
 *
 *   edit      the synthesis prompt; the agent edits `./AGENTS.md` in the staging copy
 *   annotate  backpass measures the copy against the original (`src/diff.js`) and shows
 *             the changes by id; the agent attaches kind, title, rationale, and evidence
 *
 * An empty annotation turn is retried once in a fresh session, as described below.
 *
 * The annotation is what the mechanical gates validate (`buildProposal`). A parseable
 * gate-rejected answer is saved before the agent is re-prompted with the exact breaches;
 * judged answers are bounded by ANNOTATE_TURNS, then backpass fails loudly rather than
 * quietly trimming the result (design section 6). The repo is fingerprinted around each
 * turn; a harness that wrote past the staging copy is an error, never a silent apply.
 *
 * Three things an annotate turn can be are deliberately kept apart, because they call for
 * different responses and produce different advice at the end of a failed run:
 *
 *   the files moved      the ids the agent was asked about no longer exist. It is shown the
 *                        fresh measurement and answers again; this is not a failed
 *                        annotation and never costs an annotation attempt (REMEASURE_TURNS
 *                        bounds it instead).
 *   the turn was empty   the adapter returned success with no text at all. The model never
 *                        spoke, so there is nothing to correct - the annotation is retried
 *                        once in a NEW session, since the accumulated context of the old
 *                        one is the likeliest reason it collapsed.
 *   the answer was judged the model spoke and the gates ruled. Only this consumes an
 *                        annotation attempt, and only this writes a rejected proposal.
