# Project agent memory

backpass is an npm CLI that runs a "backward pass" over a repo's agent memory files: it
discovers past agent-session transcripts tied to the repo, analyzes them, and proposes
evidence-backed edits to `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` under a token budget.

## Orientation

- `VISION.md` is the acceptance policy: what a change must be true to, and its closing
  accept/resist tests. It is self-sufficient; run that test against `VISION.md` alone.
- `README.md` documents the user-facing surface; `src/cli.js` is the authoritative flag list.
- The pipeline is one stage per module, in order: `src/discovery/` -> `src/sample.js` (cap) -> `src/distill.js` ->
  `src/analyze.js` -> `src/consolidate.js` (gap-identity merge, inside `foldForRun`) -> `src/fold.js` ->
  `src/synthesize.js` (with `src/workspace.js` + `src/diff.js`) ->
  `src/proposal.js` -> `src/apply/`. Each module's header comment explains its role; read those
  before changing a stage.
- **User-facing step names are the training-loop terms**, not the module names: discover =
  "collect samples", analyze = "calculate loss", fold = "aggregate gradients", synthesize =
  "gradient descent" (`STAGE_LABELS` in `src/tui/render.js`). Internal keys, event names, and
  the typed subcommands (`scan`, `analyze`, `propose`) keep their short names; only what the
  user reads changes. Never introduce a multi-word subcommand.
- Zero runtime dependencies, ESM, no build step. Node >= 22.5 (for `node:sqlite`).
- pnpm is the package manager; `pnpm run check` runs lint, format:check, typecheck, and
  tests. All tests are offline and use fixtures under `test/fixtures/`. Supply-chain
  settings (release-age cooldown, build-script deny) live in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`.
- **Tests must never read the machine's own user configuration.** The `test` script loads
  `test/helpers/isolate-config.js` through `--import`, which `node --test` forwards to every
  test file's child process, so `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` points at an empty temp dir before any test
  module or spawned CLI resolves `userConfigPath()`. Run one file the same way, never bare
  `node --test test/x.test.js`: without it a developer's `~/.config/backpass/config.json`
  becomes a silent layer under `loadConfig` and the suite is green only on a machine that has
  no configuration.
- Releases are automated by release-please (`.github/workflows/release-please.yml`,
  npm trusted publishing). Never hand-edit `CHANGELOG.md` or
  `.release-please-manifest.json`; CI guards reject PRs that touch them.
- `.github/workflows/no-mistakes-required.yml` is a thin caller of the shared
  `kunchenguid/no-mistakes/.github/actions/require-no-mistakes` composite action, pinned
  to an immutable commit SHA and never `@main`. Enforcement logic and tests live upstream
  in the no-mistakes repository; change enforcement there, never by copying it locally,
  and bump the pin in a deliberate separate PR. This repo still owns the `on:`,
  `concurrency`, `permissions`, job name, and author-exemption `if:`. The action binds the
  attestation to the head SHA, so a PR whose body no-mistakes did not rewrite for the
  current head goes red by contract: push through `git push no-mistakes`.

## Sharp edges

- **User-scope runs are a separate triple.** See README's User-level memory section
  for user-facing paths and defaults. Association, filters, and the synthetic homedir
  repo live in `src/scope.js`; user state never enters `<repo>/.backpass/`.
  `minGapProjects` defaults to 1 (the gate exists; cross-project corroboration is not
  required). A project-scoped run never writes a user-level file.
- **`--target` is a write surface, not a second scope or a second budget.** `resolveTarget`
  in `src/target.js` accepts only an exact configured memory-file entry or an exact loaded
  skill name; every other spelling errors with the valid names - never add a basename,
  directory, path, or glob match. A skill target keeps the primary memory file as the file
  under audit, so analysis, evidence, hashes, and the always-loaded budget are unchanged;
  only staging (`stagedSkills` in `prepareWorkspace`) and the `buildProposal` gate narrow.
  `TARGET_COMMANDS` lists where the flag applies; everything else rejects it.
- **SSH hosts are a collection tier, not a second scope.** `src/discovery/hosts.js` runs
  three remote commands per configured host - locate Node/git, probe `discover`, probe
  `fetch` - over one explicit ControlMaster that is opened before locate and closed after
  fetch or at command teardown; the descriptors join the one corpus with the same tiers, sample and
  cap. `src/discovery/remote/ssh.js` is the sole ssh spawn boundary (constant option set,
  destination/node-path refusal, `classifySshFailure`, `BACKPASS_SSH_BIN`), and a Windows
  shim refusal must be raised by name there like every other spawn. Nothing installs on
  the remote: `src/discovery/remote/bundle.js` ships `PROBE_MANIFEST` plus the request as
  one stdin program, so a stray import in a manifest module breaks every host at once -
  `test/remote-bundle.test.js` runs the probe from a directory holding only the manifest.
  The payload never reaches the remote shell; the refused node path is the only variable
  command text and is single-quoted. The locate snippet and loader bodies carry no single
  quote, backslash, or `!`. Remote tiers have no tier 1
  (nothing over there is this clone); facts come from `remote/git-facts.js`, computed
  where the paths are real, and `associateRemote` applies the local rules to them. Hosts
  are personal configuration: `discovery.hosts` in `.backpassrc.json` is a `UserError` by
  construction, which is what keeps the feature inside VISION's "never someone else's
  transcripts". Every host is fail-soft with a named message; host keys are never
  auto-accepted and `StrictHostKeyChecking=no` is never suggested.
- **A remote session's content is fetched, cached, and read through the same adapter.**
  `prefetchRemoteTranscripts` runs before the analysis pool for exactly the pending
  sampled transcripts. File-backed stores send the raw file so `rawPath` still names a
  real local file and the analysis escape hatch survives the trip; SQLite stores send the
  adapter's events, since there is no per-session file. `src/discovery/cache.js` hashes
  (host, harness, key) into a name so an untrusted remote path can never steer a write,
  writes tmp+rename, and prunes at 30 days unused. A short frame fails that one transcript
  with `remote fetch incomplete` and refetches next run - never a truncated session
  analyzed as a whole one. Identity is `ssh://<host>/<path>` (`transcriptSource`), evidence
  labels carry the host (`gapSource`), and one session present on two machines is kept
  once, local copy first.
- **Sibling clones are a live-path tier, not a recorded-remote one.** `git worktree
list` only sees this clone. `attachSiblingClones` in `src/repo.js` also searches the
  parent of each worktree (and `discovery.cloneRoots`) for other checkouts that share a
  remote, read-only, so Claude sessions whose cwd is a sibling clone still attach
  (tier 1.5). A second full clone with no overlapping remote is never associated.
- **Transcript formats are undocumented and drift.** File adapters in
  `src/discovery/adapters/` are pinned by golden fixtures in `test/fixtures/`; SQLite
  adapters (opencode, hermes) build tiny temp databases in tests. When a harness changes
  its on-disk shape, fix the adapter and its fixture/test together. Adapters must stay
  fail-soft: an unreadable store warns and is skipped, never throws.
- **`src/sample.js` sampling is deterministic and sticky, never seeded from `Math.random()`.**
  Past `maxTranscripts`, each transcript's draw (`sampleUnit`) is a hash of its own canonical
  identity (`transcriptIdentity`: harness + native id + durable source, never array position
  or title) and `config.seed` - never a shared PRNG stream stepped once per transcript. That
  prevents reruns from randomly reshuffling the sample (cache reuse is proven in
  `test/sample-reuse.test.js`, not by reading source) and keeps a transcript's draw stable
  as the corpus grows. Recency weights may still evolve with wall-clock time. A top-`count`
  selection by fixed per-transcript draw means inserting new transcripts can only displace
  existing ones, never reshuffle their draws. When the mixed corpus exceeds the cap,
  `mixAllocations` is proportional-with-floor (20%, clipped to category availability), not
  a forced 50/50 split - see `src/interaction.js` for the two public categories. Never
  reintroduce an index- or array-position-derived draw here.
- **Corpus mix is two categories, never an unknown bucket.** `classifyInteraction` in
  `src/interaction.js` labels every session interactive or non-interactive from per-harness
  signals (codex `originator`/`source`, claude `entrypoint`, OpenCode `parent_id`, Hermes
  source, `.no-mistakes` cwd). A no-mistakes pipeline run is one kind of non-interactive
  session. Missing metadata defaults to interactive. The mix is printed by scan/propose/apply
  and stamped on evidence so fold relevance is reported per category.
- **Hermes is first-class but source-filtered.** `src/discovery/adapters/hermes.js` reads
  `~/.hermes/state.db` (`HERMES_HOME`). Only `cli` and `acp` sessions are ingested;
  gateway/cron rows share a process cwd and would pollute association. v26 stores CLI cwd
  on `sessions.cwd` (system_prompt is often NULL); ACP still uses `model_config.cwd`.
  Timestamps are epoch seconds and must be converted to ms. Message content is read as
  BLOB because node:sqlite truncates TEXT at the `\x00json:` NUL. There is no JSONL fallback.
- **The live progress view is an enhancement layer, never a dependency.** Pipeline stages
  emit events through `src/progress.js`; `src/tui/` renders them on stderr during the
  default run and buffers/replays the plain logger lines on teardown. Every path must
  behave identically when it is inactive (non-TTY, CI, NO_COLOR, --quiet, --json) - plain
  line output on stderr and clean stdout are the contract. Rendering logic stays pure
  (`src/tui/render.js`) so it is testable as text.
- **`src/apply/writer.js` is the only module that writes to the repo.** Keep it that way -
  every other stage is read-only analysis, which is what makes a run safe to interrupt.
  Bootstrap (`src/commands/bootstrap.js`, a repo with no memory file) is the one run that
  writes without the apply gate, and it only ever creates files, never overwrites.
  For proposals carrying a memory-file hash, nothing is written until the gates pass:
  the memory file still exists and hashes to `proposal.memoryFile.hash` (`memoryFileSnapshot`,
  using `memoryTextHash` from `src/memory.js` so the check and the proposal cannot disagree),
  every non-memory edit target still hashes to its `proposal.targetFiles` entry (same
  contract, so a hand-edited skill refuses the apply instead of being patched blind), the
  accepted subset clears `budgetGateKind` (`src/tokens.js`), every accepted edit for a file
  composes against that file's one pre-write image, every created skill target is still
  absent, and, when the proposal carries any skill writes, the current run's resolved
  `skillsDir` (defaulting to the canonical skills dir when unset) still matches
  `proposal.config.skillsDir` - a mismatch refuses the apply naming both values rather than
  writing to the stale propose-time path. Any of them failing writes nothing and records no
  rejection. Accepted paths are
  resolved before mutation, and duplicate resolved targets refuse the whole apply. Each file
  is therefore applied whole or not at all. Skills and non-memory files land before the
  memory file; a later failure rolls back files, skills, and loading-layout entries created
  by the round. A rollback never overwrites a file whose identity or contents changed after
  this round committed it - that conflict is reported and the concurrent version is kept.
- **Synthesis edits natively, in a staging copy, never by describing text.** The agent
  gets `--approve-all` with `cwd` = `.backpass/synthesis/` (`prepareWorkspace`), which holds
  only the memory file and the skills dir; backpass measures the copy (`measureWorkspace`,
  `anchoredHunks`) and the agent annotates the measured changes by id, initially in the
  same session. Synthesis sessions request `writeAccess`; analysis remains read-only.
  `src/harness-invoke.js` owns the per-harness write-capability contract. The model never
  supplies `find` text - every hunk is cut from the raw
  file, widened until unique, so a hunk can only go stale by the file itself changing after
  the proposal, which apply refuses rather than part-applies. Never pass
  `approveAll` with the repo as `cwd`; the repo is fingerprinted and a harness that
  writes there fails the run loudly. Staging withholds a loaded skill it could never write -
  one resolving outside the repository, or into a location nothing may write - naming the
  reason in the skill index, and the fingerprint follows staging: a withheld file is one
  backpass has guaranteed it will never write, so a third party's edit to it must not abort
  the run. Staging and the fingerprint must stay in step.
- **Annotate-loop outcomes stay distinct** (`annotateLoop` in `src/synthesize.js`): a
  moved staging tree is re-measured without spending an `ANNOTATE_TURNS` attempt (bounded
  by `REMEASURE_TURNS`); no adapter text is retried once in a new session; and only a
  non-empty answer spends an annotation attempt. Only a parseable, gate-rejected answer
  writes a rejected `proposal.json` during the loop, stamped with `attempt`.
  `ProposalViolation` carries `reason` and the `saved` proposal's own attempt/violations
  so a later empty turn is never reported as that proposal's author. A new synthesis clears
  the prior proposal before its first model
  call, so an empty-only failure cannot leave an older proposal applicable.
  `synthesisFailureHint` in `src/commands/propose.js` is
  where the advice for each terminal condition lives - never a blanket
  stronger-model/budget/max-edits line. A blank or unparseable first annotate turn is
  reported as `edit-empty`, not the generic `empty`/`unparseable` reason, when the edit
  turn left the staging copy and all in-scope files byte-identical to the original - a
  stray out-of-scope write counts as touched, so it is never hidden behind `edit-empty` -
  there was nothing to annotate, so retrying burns no attempts. That check only fires on the loop's first turn;
  a later turn's empty diff still means the model undid its own edit mid-annotation, which
  stays `editing`/`empty`/`unparseable`. It never overrides a _parseable_ answer, even
  `{edits: []}`, because an agent that changed nothing yielding an empty proposal is a
  success, not a failure (`VISION.md`).
- **An extract is one measured memory change plus the skill(s) it pays for.** `anchoredHunks`
  merges adjacent removals, so extracting neighbouring sections yields one change and N
  skills - one honest accept/reject decision, since a merged change cannot be
  half-accepted. `buildProposal` allows N skills only when they share ONE memory hunk;
  separately measured skills must stay separate edits. An extract may create `SKILL.md`
  or extend an existing one when the staged file still has every prior line plus every
  line the memory hunks remove (`normalizeRecoveryLine`). A `move` is the same verbatim
  carry inside the memory file: normalized removed and added line multisets must match
  exactly, so repositioning cannot smuggle additions and does not hit the harm floor.
  Edits carry `skills: []` for
  created files; read them through `editSkills` (`src/skills.js`), which also understands
  the pre-0.1.8 single `skill`. Writer apply splits a multi-file extract by hunk `file`
  (`filesOfEdit` / `sliceEditForFile` in `src/proposal.js`).
- **Extraction and deletion never share one decision.** `measureWorkspace` splits a pure
  removal that mixes skill-carried and vanishing text at that boundary (`splitRemovalHunk`;
  a split that cannot anchor uniquely keeps the merged hunk instead of guessing). In
  `buildProposal`, an extract's skills must carry every line its memory hunks remove
  (dash-and-whitespace-folded, `normalizeRecoveryLine`), and any other edit whose hunk only
  deletes memory-file text is a removal whatever its kind: each deleted unit needs
  `minGapEvidence` distinct sessions of `class: "harm"` negatives (`harmSessions` in the
  fold). Extract and move skip that floor because the text never leaves the always-loaded
  surface. The same floor covers skill files, where no evidence can attribute at all, so a
  pure deletion inside a skill file is refused outright - skill content is rewritten or
  extracted, never dropped. Non-compliance never satisfies the floor; the >= 20%-relevance
  placement table stays prompt guidance by the captain's explicit decision - do not harden it.
- **One session floor covers the whole always-loaded surface.** Every edit whose kind is
  not `extract` or `move` must quote `minGapEvidence` distinct sessions - add, rewrite and
  remove alike. `buildProposal` discards empty quote text, then counts canonical non-empty
  source labels from the edit's own `evidence` that also appear in `summary.sources`
  (the labels this run's fold issued; `gapSource` / `disambiguateSourceLabels` in
  `src/gap-ledger.js`, folded in `src/fold.js`). Labels must remain one-to-one with
  canonical sessions; `test/proposal.test.js` covers the evidence-floor contract. The
  model's `transcripts` field is not read. A misspelled or date-shifted label is not a second session. Sourceless quotes
  remain visible as `unknown source` but do not count. There is no shape predicate
  separating an additive rewrite from a tightening, so a one-session tightening is
  refused too. Never reintroduce a lexical-overlap, token-growth, or other text classifier
  here. In user scope the same edits also clear `minGapProjects` (unchanged default),
  counted by `countedEvidenceProjects` from cited gap clusters and from
  `summary.sourceProjects`, the fold's source -> project map that lets instruction-row
  evidence answer for a rewrite. Keep that map keyed by the same unique labels.
  `sourceProjects` is empty without a project;
  `summary.sources` is the allowlist for both scopes.
- **Negative evidence has a sign the pipeline must not lose.** Analysis classifies every
  negative (`harm` / `non-compliance` / `irrelevant`, `sanitizeEvidence` drops other
  values) and `renderEvidenceForPrompt` renders the class AND the `effect` text with each
  quote. Records from before the class existed carry none, and none never counts as harm.
- **A quote must be findable in the trace it claims to come from.** `sanitizeEvidence`
  (`src/analyze.js`) drops any evidence item whose quote is not a whitespace-folded
  substring of the distilled trace, counting the drops into `summary.quotesNotInTrace` so a
  paraphrasing model reads as that rather than as a clean repo. Only the literal boolean
  `usedRawTranscript === true` opts out, because then the quote may come from text the
  distiller elided. Consequence for tests: a fake agent must quote real text from the
  session it analyzes - invented quotes are exactly what the gate rejects. Analysis
  semantics changed, so `ANALYSIS_INDEX_VERSION` (`src/state.js`) was bumped; bump it again
  for any future change to what analysis accepts.
- **Skill target/load-layout rules live in `src/skills.js`.** Preserve an existing configured
  harness-loaded directory; a bare `skills/` directory is never auto-detected. A harness loads
  what a path resolves to, so a symlinked directory under the loaded dir is a skill: entry types
  are stat'd (`isDirectoryEntry`), fail-soft, and a broken or cyclic link reads as absent. One
  library reached through k links is k loaded entries, billed k times - `loadedCopies` multiplies
  a description-line delta by that count in both `buildProposal` and the writer's projection.
- **Memory resolution is pointer-aware** (`resolveMemoryFiles` in `src/memory.js`): the
  first configured file is canonical, a `@AGENTS.md`-only CLAUDE.md is a pointer, and a
  second full file is warned about, never silently ignored or double-written.
- **Oversized paragraphs split for attribution only.** `parseMemoryUnits` still emits one
  positional `AG-nnn` per paragraph or list item (apply, reanchor, and the removal floor
  stay line-oriented). Eligible prose above `ATTRIBUTION_SPLIT_TOKENS` can also get
  `AG-nnn.m` parts at high-confidence sentence boundaries; ambiguous spans conservatively remain
  unsplit. The instruction index and fold use those parts so evidence cannot smear across a
  blob, and synthesis is told to restructure repeated non-compliance into list items rather
  than bold-label it. See `src/memory.js` and `renderEvidenceForPrompt` in `src/fold.js`.
- **The apply surface's funnel band is presentation, and its counters must stay that way.**
  `templates/apply.html` draws one band from findings to edits proposed on one scale, in two
  lanes (an existing instruction, a missing one), each drop named in plain words. It is fed by
  display-only counters - `reportOnlyByReason` and `instructionsWithNegatives` in the fold's
  `totals`, plus the instruction-outcome counters in `buildProposal` - that no gate may ever
  read; changing what the band shows must never change what is proposed or refused.
  A proposal lacking them falls back to the classic stat row rather than inventing zeros.
- **Never trust model-reported numbers.** Token deltas, budget projections and an edit's
  session count are measured in `src/proposal.js` from the actual text and quotes; the
  synthesis model's own figures are ignored.
  Usage accounting comes from acpx's `[acpx] tokens:` stderr line, which acpx prints
  when the ACP adapter returns usage (codex, claude do; pi-acp does not), with one
  harness-store fallback: pi's per-turn usage is read back from its own session file,
  located by the prompt text (`recoverUsageFromStore` in `src/acpx.js`). Records are
  `{ agent, usage|null }` (`usageRecord` in `src/acpx.js`) and `src/commands/usage.js` is
  the one place that prints them - never `n/a`: nothing when no call ran, the harness by
  name when it stayed silent.
- **Fold and this-run gap-ledger ingest require selected, current evidence.**
  The run hash (`primaryMemoryFile` in `src/commands/analyze.js`) is `memorySurfaceHash`:
  the memory-set hash extended with every skill's description line - a description edit
  invalidates cached evidence, a skill-body edit never does, and a repo without skills
  keeps the plain set hash. The always-loaded budget gate measures the same surface
  (memory file + description lines; bodies stay free until triggered), so a repo with
  many skills re-tunes `budgetTokens` once - accepted by the captain's explicit decision.
  `foldForRun` (`src/commands/propose.js`) matches evidence to the selected sample by
  canonical `transcriptIdentity`, then requires the current memory path, surface hash,
  transcript signature, `ANALYSIS_INDEX_VERSION`, and a valid interaction stamp through
  `isEvidenceFresh`. The same selection bounds this run's gap-ledger observations, so an
  old record outside the window or cap cannot overwhelm the sampled corpus. Folding does
  not migrate, rewrite, or delete excluded evidence; ordinary discovery and analysis
  backfill legacy records when selected. `analyzeTranscripts` separately reports
  `summary.staleMemoryHash` and names the old/new hash on stderr, so a full reanalysis
  without `--force` after a memory edit reads as "the file changed," not as a broken cache.
- **Cross-surface duplication is report-only.** `crossSurfaceDuplicates` (`src/overlap.js`)
  flags memory-file units whose text substantially overlaps a skill description or body
  (Dice >= 0.6, same bar as gap coverage). Fold renders each overlap once in the evidence,
  including an oversized parent that has no instruction row, and `backpass status` lists it.
  Description overlap duplicates always-loaded tokens and can guide a shrink to drop the
  memory-file copy. Body overlap is only placement evidence: a
  skill body loads on trigger, so its memory copy may be the only always-loaded coverage.
  Nothing is deleted automatically. Relevance still accrues to the memory-file alias until
  that copy is gone.
- **Gap corroboration persists across runs through `.backpass/gap-ledger.json`**
  (`src/gap-ledger.js`, wired in `foldForRun`): one sighting per (gap, transcript id), so a
  session never counts twice. A run only folds ledger observations from its selected sample;
  persisted sessions outside the cap cannot reintroduce a skewed corpus. Record this run's
  evidence _before_ pruning - old evidence files stay on disk and would re-add an expired or
  covered sighting otherwise. Uncorroborated gaps stay hidden; never surface singletons to
  the prompt or report.
- **Gap identity is judged, not word-matched.** Bigram similarity cannot recognize real
  paraphrase (measured on production data: max cross-session score 0.34 vs the 0.45 bar),
  so it is only the fallback. The analysis turn cites open-gap ids (`matchesGap`, shown via
  `renderOpenGapIndex`; an invalid citation falls back, never fails), and, with at least two
  open entries, `foldForRun` runs ONE consolidation call (`src/consolidate.js`) that merges paraphrased entries
  (`mergeGapEntries`) - record, consolidate, prune, in that order. Consolidation failure
  degrades to lexical identity with a warning, never an abort. Gaps also carry `domain`;
  `orchestration` sightings (mistakes caused by the external harness or tooling that
  orchestrated the task, not by this repo) are counted in
  `totals.orchestrationGapSightings` and travel into clustering as votes. Cluster
  domain is decided after grouping (`src/fold.js`): withhold a cluster from a
  proposal only when a majority of its sightings vote orchestration (ties stay
  project). Mixed clusters always appear in the evidence report with total and
  orchestration sighting counts, so one inconsistent classifier call cannot drop a real
  recurrence below `minGapEvidence`. There is deliberately no orchestrator-memory
  write path. When this repository IS that orchestrating tool, those mistakes are
  `project` (`src/prompts/analysis.md`).
  A gap may also carry `coveredBySkill`: the analysis (shown every skill's name and
  trigger line) judged an existing skill's content to cover the mistake - a failed
  trigger. The fold counts those citations per skill onto the cluster
  (`failedTriggerSkill`/`failedTriggerSessions`) so synthesis fixes the description
  with real cross-session evidence, and skill content joins `pruneGapLedger` coverage
  so a gap resolved by a skill retires instead of aging out.
- **backpass must never analyze itself.** Its own acpx calls are filed by each harness
  under the repo's cwd, a tier-1 match. Every prompt starts with `SELF_SESSION_SENTINEL`
  (`src/prompts.js`) and discovery drops transcripts whose first user message begins with
  it (`src/discovery/self.js`) before sampling. Keep the sentinel on every model-facing
  prompt; the triviality filter is not a substitute.
- **A Windows shim refusal must be raised by name, before any generic handling.** On
  Windows every spawn of an npm `.cmd` goes through `windowsShimLaunch` (`src/subprocess.js`),
  which refuses an argument no quoting can neutralise (`%VAR%`, a double quote, a newline)
  rather than passing it to cmd.exe. That refusal arrives as a result with `code: null` and
  `spawnError.code === "ERR_WINDOWS_SHIM_UNSAFE_ARG"`, so any boundary that inspects the
  result generically first degrades it into "no session support", "exit null" or "failed to
  open the apply surface" - none of which names the refused value. Two rounds of this change
  were spent chasing that degradation at two separate boundaries. Today `run` in `src/acpx.js`
  is the single funnel for every model call and `openApplySurface` in `src/apply/lavish.js`
  covers apply; a new spawn boundary must raise it the same way.
- **acpx is alpha.** All model invocation is isolated behind `src/acpx.js` so an upstream
  CLI change has one blast radius. v1 uses plain `exec` and named sessions only; acpx flows
  are deferred until they are stable upstream. The one sanctioned exception is the
  per-harness native status table in `src/agents.js` (`claude auth status`, `opencode models`).
  Grok overlays ride acpx `--agent`; that hatch has no `-s` of its own (acpx 0.13.x:
  `unknown option '-s'`), so `openSession`'s `prompt()` sends the `prompt` subcommand
  before `-s` when `acpxAgentCommand` is set. Built-in agents keep the implicit form.
- **Only acpx session creation gets the adapter cold-start budget.** Built-in adapters may
  launch through a package-exec bridge, so `sessions new` uses
  `SESSION_CREATE_TIMEOUT_MS`; probe status/close retain `PROBE_TIMEOUT_MS` (including its
  per-agent override), and open sessions keep their shorter post-create limits. Handle
  `result.timedOut` before generic non-zero exits so a stalled create is never reported as
  missing session support. `test/acpx-session-create-timeout.test.js` covers both contracts.
- **Model and effort overrides are invocation-scoped.** Never ACP `set model` / Pi
  `set thought_level` (those rewrite `~/.pi/agent/settings.json`) and never edit-then-restore
  harness defaults. `src/harness-invoke.js` owns the harness overlay mechanisms and
  `src/acpx.js` owns verification and fallback. An unproven overlay must stop rather than
  pretend. Preserve the current spawn when no override is requested.
- **Agent auto-pick is probe-then-verify, never probe-only.** `src/agents.js` walks each
  role's ladder with a zero-token probe, but the claude adapter cannot be pre-verified by
  acpx (sessions succeed while logged out), so every real call runs under
  `AgentResolver.withFallthrough`, which demotes a candidate on a classifiable failure
  (`classifyAcpxFailure`). Effortful calls go through `sessionPrompt` so the overlay in
  `src/harness-invoke.js` can apply. Verdicts cache in `.backpass/agent-probe-cache.json`;
  Pi and OpenCode entries carry `providerAuthState`, so credential changes invalidate them.
  A probe miss retries once with backoff (`probeAndRecord` in `src/agents.js`); a timeout,
  a bare `exit N`, or an empty advertised-model list is never written as a negative cache
  hit, so a busy harness cannot poison the next run.
- **An ambiguous advertised model is ranked by auth class, never guessed.** Pi (and any
  harness that lists `provider/id`) can advertise the same bare ladder id under a
  subscription provider and an API-key provider - classic case: `openai-codex/gpt-5.6-luna`
  vs `openai/gpt-5.6-luna` when `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set. `resolveModelId` prefers the
  subscription-backed prefix using `src/provider-auth.js` (Pi provider definitions plus
  `auth.json` `type`; OpenCode's own auth file, where `openai` is ChatGPT OAuth). Prefix
  semantics are harness-specific. An unrankable collision is a loud `model-unavailable`
  that names the ids and tells the user to pass a provider-qualified id - never a silent
  pick, and never "model not advertised" with the ids hidden. The probe trail prints a
  winning tie-break.
- **The Lavish apply surface is chatty and its output is YAML-quoted.** `lavish-axi poll`
  can return feedback that is not a decision vector (a comment, a queued layout report) any
  number of times before the real one; `pollDecisions` in `src/apply/lavish.js` announces
  each wait state once and never per cycle. Session URLs are printed as `url: "http://..."`,
  so parse them with `extractUrl`, never a bare `\S+`. Browser launch is best effort
  (`src/apply/browser.js`): the printed URL is the contract. `test/fixtures/fake-lavish/`
  stands in for the CLI via `BACKPASS_LAVISH_BIN` in tests. `injectPayload` in
  `src/apply/lavish.js` must splice the templated `<script>` tag into `apply.html` with a
  function replacer, never a string one: a string second argument to `String.prototype.replace`
  interprets `$&`, `` $` ``, `$'`, and `$$` in it as replacement patterns, and the spliced
  text embeds untrusted proposal/evidence prose that can contain those sequences verbatim.
- Cursor IDE support is deliberately deferred to v1.1 (`--include-cursor-ide`, best effort);
  see the header of `src/discovery/adapters/cursor-ide.js` for why.
